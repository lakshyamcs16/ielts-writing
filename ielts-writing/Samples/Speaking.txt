Today I am going to talk about a miniature toolkit toy that my father bought for me on my 10th birthday but only after I had pestered him for weeks.
This toy was inspired by a tv show for juveniles, called Bob the builder. It included a host of tools that we could use to build new things or
restore the broken ones. There was also a manual in the box which included methods, tips and procedures to get a head start on building new things in order
to foster learning in kids. I loved this toy because it was a versatile toy with which I could make anything! It seemed like just one toy but in fact it 
could take any form that was desired. I learnt a great deal from this toolkit, in fact it helped in building a strong foundation for my career of engineering 
because it induced innovation and encouraged me to be more creative. I remember, I was so thrilled when I developed a small scale replica of a windmill which 
not only was able to produce enough energy to light up a bulb but also helped me in understanding the core principle behind renewable source of energy. 
This made me curious so much so that I took my innovative mind to participate in a science fair at regional level and entered the competition with a model of 
hydro-power plant. This small scale plant harnessed running tap water to generate electricity. Although the energy produced wasn't enough to run a large appliance
but it wasstrong enough to keep a mini motor running for hours. However, one thing that I did not like about this toy was that it could be a safety hazard as
it involved working with wires, batteries and electricity strong enough to damage nerves and tissues. Perhaps, they could add an elaborated section on safety
tips before working with this toy.
